/**
 * Event-loop blocking ratchet.
 *
 * The web server is single-threaded: ONE synchronous blocking call anywhere on
 * its event loop freezes EVERY route, including static index.html. Shipped
 * outages of exactly this shape:
 *  - 2026-08-11: a synchronous ScreenCaptureKit native call (getAudioApps) on
 *    the /api/audio/apps request path spun a CFRunLoop for minutes — the whole
 *    app "stuck on refresh".
 *  - 2026-07: gitPull via execSync blocked the loop mid-request.
 *
 * This test is a RATCHET, not a linter: every existing execSync/spawnSync call
 * site is grandfathered into the baseline below. Adding a NEW one fails the
 * quick tier with instructions. Removing one? Delete it from the baseline so
 * the ratchet only tightens.
 *
 * The rule (also in AGENTS.md → "Never block the web server's event loop"):
 * run blocking work in a child process/worker with a timeout and serve a
 * cached value — see refreshAppsInBackground in src/core/audio-capture.ts.
 * `setImmediate` does NOT count as a fix: deferred sync work still blocks.
 *
 * Files that never share the web server's event loop are exempt (workers/,
 * the daemon twins, CLI-only hooks) — listed in EXEMPT_PATHS.
